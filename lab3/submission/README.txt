I modified the user program to not write the entire pages available in the flash memory cause it took too long.

Sorry for the quality, the usual sw I use to record (xbox game bar) can't record multiple windows so I had to
make do with handheld phone camera. Originally I thought I had a big brain and video called myself to have everything
on one screen...

Thx :)
